# AWS_notes
Notes to help with AWS CCP certification. These notes can be used as a form of revision and to aid in understanding the content needed to succeed.

I advise that the text files are read and revised in the following order:

1. What is cloud computing
2. IAM
3. EC2
4. EC2 instance storage
