What is cloud computing:

- Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database storage, applications and other It based resources.
- Cloud computing is delivered through a cloud service platform with pay-as-you go pricing.
- You can control and determine the attributes (size and computing resources) that you require.
- You can access the resources you need within minutes.
- It is a simple way to access servers, storage, databases and a set of application services.

AWS owns and maintains the servers and their hardware. As a user, you provison and use what you need through a web aplication.


Problems solved by the cloud:

Flexibility: You can change the resource types when needed.
Cost eefective: Pay-as-you-go. You only pay for what you use.
Scalability: Accomodate larger loads by making hardware stronger or adding aditional nodes.
Elasticity: Ability to scale out and in as and when needed.
High availibility and fault tolerence: Built accross multiple data centres.
Agility: Focus less on infrastructure and spend more time focusing on your product allowing you to rapidly develop, test and launch
software applications.


The 6 advantages of cloud computing:

1. Trade capital expense (CAPEX) for operational expense (OPEX). This means you pay on demand and don't own hardware. This results in
resduced total cost of ownership (TCO) and operational exense (OPEX)

2. You benefit from massive economies of scale - Prices are reduced as AWS is more efficient due to it's large scale.

3. Stop guessing capacity - You can scale based on your actual measured usage.

4. Increase speed and agility.

5. Stop spending money running and maintaining data centres.


Cloud models:

private cloud:
- Cloud services used by a single organisation, not exposed to the public.
- Complete control over every aspect
- High security for sensitive applications
- Meet specific business needs. 

Public cloud:
- Cloud resources owned and operated by a 3rd party cloud service provider delivered over the internet.
- Six advantages of coud computing (mentioned above)

Hybrid coud:
- keep some servers on premesis and extend some capabilities to the cloud
- Control over sensetive assests in your private infrastructure.
- Flexibility and cost effectiveness of the public cloud.
6. Go global in minutes: leverage the AWS global infrastructure.



The 5 characteristics of cloud computing:

1. ON-demand service - No human interaction necessary. You can just aquire resources through the web app.

2. Broad network access - resources available over network and can be accessed by diverse cliet platforms.

3. Multi-tenancy and resources pooling - Multiple customers share the same infrastructure and apps with security and privacy.
Multiple customers are serverd from the same physical resources.

4. Rapid elasticity and scalibility - Automatically and quckly aquire and disose of resources when needed. Quickly and easily
scale based on demand.

5. measured device usage - usage is measured and users pay correctly for the resources they have used.
