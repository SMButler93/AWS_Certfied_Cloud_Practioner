#EC2

EC2 = Elastic Compute Cloud.

This is an IaaS service from AWS (Infrastructure as a service).

This one of AWS' most popular services. It consists of the following:
  • Renting virtual machines (EC2 - Elastic Cloud Compute)
  • Storing data on virtual drives (EBS - Elastic Block Store)
  • Distributing load across machines (ELB - Elastic Load Balancing)
  • Scaling the services using an auto-scaling group (ASG - Auto Scaling Groups)

Knowing EC2 is fundamental to understanding how the cloud actually works.


EC2 size and configuration options and choices:
  • Operating System (Mac, Windows, Linux)
  • The amount of computing power and cores (CPU)
  • The amount of random access memory (RAM)
  • The amount of stgorage space:
    • Network attached (EBS and EFS)
    • Hardware (EC2 Instance store)
  • Firewall rukes - The security group.
  • Network card - Public IP address and speed of the card.
  • Bootstrap script (scripts that will run when the instance is first booted up hence the name 'BOOTstrap')
  
 
EC2 User Data:

We can use EC2 user data script to bootstarp our instances. This essentially means launching commands when we first boot up the
machine. This is only run once and does not repeat once the instance is up and runing.

We use 
this EC2 user data to automate boot tasks such as:
  • Installing updates
  • Installing software
  • Downloading common files from the internet
  • Pretty much anything you can think of!
 
 It is important to remember that the user data script runs with the root user.
 
 
 EC2 instance types:
 
 When launching and creating EC2 instances, you can choose different configurations to match the task you want them to perform.
 Before we look at these different types, take not eof the nmaing conventions used by AWS:
 
 You will be presented with something like this:
 
 t2.2xlarge

The 'T' represents the instance class (more on these shortly)
The '2' represents the generation. (This will change as AWS updata and improve)
The '2xlarge' is the size within the instance class.
