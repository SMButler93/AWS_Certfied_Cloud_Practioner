EC2 = Elastic Compute Cloud.

This is an IaaS service from AWS (Infrastructure as a service).

This one of AWS' most popular services. It consists of the following:

  • Storing data on virtual drives (EBS - Elastic Block Store)
  • Distributing load across machines (ELB - Elastic Load Balancing)

Knowing EC2 is fundamental to understanding how the cloud actually works.
