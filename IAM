#IAM:

IAM stands for Identity Access Management.

Through IAM, you can create users, modify user access, generate passwords, set password reset frequency and password necessities, create groups, and more.

IAM users:
Through the root user, you can create users. Each person should have their onw user account, and these accounts should not be shared. When creating a
user, you assign permissins through a policy. The policy is a JSON document which states what a user is and isn't allowed to do and have access to. 

You can assign these policies to an individual user and this is known as inline. What you can also do is create groups. These groups will be for users
that share the same or similar job roles and will require the same permissions. You can create Admin, Developer, and more groups. These groups will then
have a policy assigned to them and every user within that group will inherit the policy. Users may belong to multiple groups and have multiple policies.
